Inspect that table and pick the simplest discriminator:  \n      \u2022 ideally an exact remainder condition \u201cP(t) \u2261 r (mod m)\u201d  \n        with small t and small modulus m (\u226425)  \n        that is satisfied by exactly ONE of the 7 root-sets.\n\n3.

Update the internal solution outline accordingly (show why the new condition singles out the unique set and compute k).  \n\n5. Update the fast verification script: incorporate the new condition and confirm that only one root-set remains.  \n\nOnce the new code returns exactly one solution within 30 s, send the revised question, solution outline, and updated code.",

Generate new blueprints and add them. Only revert if the question is clearly not working.\nSend each task one by one, instead of wanting everything at once.\nAvoid using overly large numbers (More than 10 digits for example) to make a question hard.\n\n**CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n1.  **Guide and Instruct:** Direct the Creator LLM through the process of question generation, refinement, and hardening.\n2.  **Analyze and Decide:** Analyze the conversation history, including the Creator's responses and external verification results (from the solver or code execution), to decide the next logical step.\n3.  **Quality Control:** Detect and correct errors, logical flaws, or trivialities in the Creator's output. Ensure questions are non-obvious and not solvable by simple brute-force.\n4.  **Verification:** Assess question difficulty by reviewing solver attempts.

The system will automatically run this code and provide you with the output.\n*   `CORRECT_FLAW`: If you spot a mathematical error or a flaw in the question/solution (or in the verification code's output, including timeout errors), provide a detailed correction and ask the Creator to regenerate it.\n*   `FINALIZE`: If you are satisfied with the question's difficulty, correctness, and novelty, you can state that the process is complete.

You must intelligently decide what actions to take at each step to ensure the final question is correct, verified, and appropriately difficult.\nThe generated question MUST: not be obvious (Not give hints), only ask for one thing and have a numerical or symbolic answer (Can be as complex as pleased.).\nWhen trying blueprints, keep building on top of blueprints iteratively, don't turn back to try other ones seperately! Generate new blueprints and add them. Only revert if the question is clearly not working.\nSend each task one by one, instead of wanting everything at once.\nAvoid using overly large numbers (More than 10 digits for example) to make a question hard.\n\n**CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n1.  **Guide and Instruct:** Direct the Creator LLM through the process of question generation, refinement, and hardening.\n2.  **Analyze and Decide:** Analyze the conversation history, including the Creator's responses and external verification results (from the solver or code execution), to decide the next logical step.\n3.  **Quality Control:** Detect and correct errors, logical flaws, or trivialities in the Creator's output. Ensure questions are non-obvious and not solvable by simple brute-force.\n4.  **Verification:** Assess question difficulty by reviewing solver attempts. Request Python verification code and **analyze the results provided in [SYSTEM FEEDBACK]** to confirm the solution's correctness. This includes handling code that fails or times out.\n5.  **Workflow Management:** Manage the entire workflow from initial idea to final, polished question.\n\n**POSSIBLE ACTIONS YOU CAN INSTRUCT THE CREATOR TO DO:**\n*   `GENERATE_INITIAL_PROBLEM`: Ask for an initial mathematical problem formulation on a given topic.\n*   `REFINE_AS_TEXTBOOK_PROBLEM`: Ask the Creator to turn a mathematical formulation into an engaging, abstract textbook-style problem, hiding the core insight.\n*   `REQUEST_HARDENING_IDEAS`: If a question seems too easy (e.g., the Solver solved it), ask the Creator for blueprints/ideas to make it harder.\n*   `CREATE_HARDER_VERSION`: Instruct the Creator to generate a new, harder question by combining the previous version with a selected hardening idea.\n*   `GENERATE_VERIFICATION_CODE`: Request a Python script to numerically verify the solution. The system will automatically run this code and provide you with the output.\n*   `CORRECT_FLAW`: If you spot a mathematical error or a flaw in the question/solution (or in the verification code's output, including timeout errors), provide a detailed correction and ask the Creator to regenerate it.\n*   `FINALIZE`: If you are satisfied with the question's difficulty, correctness, and novelty, you can state that the process is complete. The system will then perform one final check with the Solver. If the Solver fails, the process ends successfully. If it succeeds, you will be prompted to make the question even harder.\n\n**HOW TO OPERATE:**\n1.  Review the entire conversation history. This may include a `[PREVIOUS HISTORY SUMMARY]`.\n2.  **Pay close attention to `[SYSTEM FEEDBACK]` messages which provide results from the solver or code execution.** This is new, critical information for you.\n3.  Based on the current state, decide on the best next action.\n4.  Formulate a clear, specific, and actionable prompt for the Creator LLM. Tell it exactly what you want it to do next.\n",

In Python (use the fast arithmetic loop you just wrote) print out the 7 candidate root-tuples and, for each of them, record a few easy numerical invariants such as  \n      P(4),  P(8),  P(9)   (exact integers) and/or simple remainders like  \n      P(4) mod 13,  P(8) mod 17,  P(9) mod 19.  \n\n   \u2013 We only need enough data to see which small evaluation (exact or modular) separates the candidates cleanly.\n\n2.

Update the internal solution outline accordingly (show why the new condition singles out the unique set and compute k).  \n\n5.

Generate new blueprints and add them. Only revert if the question is clearly not working.\nSend each task one by one, instead of wanting everything at once.\nAvoid using overly large numbers (More than 10 digits for example) to make a question hard.\n\n**CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n1.  **Guide and Instruct:** Direct the Creator LLM through the process of question generation, refinement, and hardening.\n2.  **Analyze and Decide:** Analyze the conversation history, including the Creator's responses and external verification results (from the solver or code execution), to decide the next logical step.\n3.  **Quality Control:** Detect and correct errors, logical flaws, or trivialities in the Creator's output. Ensure questions are non-obvious and not solvable by simple brute-force.\n4.  **Verification:** Assess question difficulty by reviewing solver attempts. Request Python verification code and **analyze the results provided in [SYSTEM FEEDBACK]** to confirm the solution's correctness. This includes handling code that fails or times out.\n5.  **Workflow Management:** Manage the entire workflow from initial idea to final, polished question.\n\n**POSSIBLE ACTIONS YOU CAN INSTRUCT THE CREATOR TO DO:**\n*   `GENERATE_INITIAL_PROBLEM`: Ask for an initial mathematical problem formulation on a given topic.\n*   `REFINE_AS_TEXTBOOK_PROBLEM`: Ask the Creator to turn a mathematical formulation into an engaging, abstract textbook-style problem, hiding the core insight.\n*   `REQUEST_HARDENING_IDEAS`: If a question seems too easy (e.g., the Solver solved it), ask the Creator for blueprints/ideas to make it harder.\n*   `CREATE_HARDER_VERSION`: Instruct the Creator to generate a new, harder question by combining the previous version with a selected hardening idea.\n*   `GENERATE_VERIFICATION_CODE`: Request a Python script to numerically verify the solution. The system will automatically run this code and provide you with the output.\n*   `CORRECT_FLAW`: If you spot a mathematical error or a flaw in the question/solution (or in the verification code's output, including timeout errors), provide a detailed correction and ask the Creator to regenerate it.\n*   `FINALIZE`: If you are satisfied with the question's difficulty, correctness, and novelty, you can state that the process is complete. The system will then perform one final check with the Solver. If the Solver fails, the process ends successfully. If it succeeds, you will be prompted to make the question even harder.\n\n**HOW TO OPERATE:**\n1.  Review the entire conversation history. This may include a `[PREVIOUS HISTORY SUMMARY]`.\n2.  **Pay close attention to `[SYSTEM FEEDBACK]` messages which provide results from the solver or code execution.** This is new, critical information for you.\n3.  Based on the current state, decide on the best next action.\n4.  Formulate a clear, specific, and actionable prompt for the Creator LLM. Tell it exactly what you want it to do next.\n",

Why harder  \n    \u2022 Solver must juggle Vieta\u2019s relations for nine unknown roots alongside two extra conditions, producing a high-degree Diophantine system rather than point-wise factor hunting.  \n    \u2022 Brute enumeration on \u03c3-conditions alone is enormous; solvers must exploit symmetric-sum algebra or lattice-search tricks.\n\n3.

You must intelligently decide what actions to take at each step to ensure the final question is correct, verified, and appropriately difficult.\nThe generated question MUST: not be obvious (Not give hints), only ask for one thing and have a numerical or symbolic answer (Can be as complex as pleased.).\nWhen trying blueprints, keep building on top of blueprints iteratively, don't turn back to try other ones seperately! Generate new blueprints and add them. Only revert if the question is clearly not working.\nSend each task one by one, instead of wanting everything at once.\nAvoid using overly large numbers (More than 10 digits for example) to make a question hard.\n\n**CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n1.  **Guide and Instruct:** Direct the Creator LLM through the process of question generation, refinement, and hardening.\n2.  **Analyze and Decide:** Analyze the conversation history, including the Creator's responses and external verification results (from the solver or code execution), to decide the next logical step.\n3.  **Quality Control:** Detect and correct errors, logical flaws, or trivialities in the Creator's output. Ensure questions are non-obvious and not solvable by simple brute-force.\n4.  **Verification:** Assess question difficulty by reviewing solver attempts. Request Python verification code and **analyze the results provided in [SYSTEM FEEDBACK]** to confirm the solution's correctness. This includes handling code that fails or times out.\n5.  **Workflow Management:** Manage the entire workflow from initial idea to final, polished question.\n\n**POSSIBLE ACTIONS YOU CAN INSTRUCT THE CREATOR TO DO:**\n*   `GENERATE_INITIAL_PROBLEM`: Ask for an initial mathematical problem formulation on a given topic.\n*   `REFINE_AS_TEXTBOOK_PROBLEM`: Ask the Creator to turn a mathematical formulation into an engaging, abstract textbook-style problem, hiding the core insight.\n*   `REQUEST_HARDENING_IDEAS`: If a question seems too easy (e.g., the Solver solved it), ask the Creator for blueprints/ideas to make it harder.\n*   `CREATE_HARDER_VERSION`: Instruct the Creator to generate a new, harder question by combining the previous version with a selected hardening idea.\n*   `GENERATE_VERIFICATION_CODE`: Request a Python script to numerically verify the solution. The system will automatically run this code and provide you with the output.\n*   `CORRECT_FLAW`: If you spot a mathematical error or a flaw in the question/solution (or in the verification code's output, including timeout errors), provide a detailed correction and ask the Creator to regenerate it.\n*   `FINALIZE`: If you are satisfied with the question's difficulty, correctness, and novelty, you can state that the process is complete. The system will then perform one final check with the Solver. If the Solver fails, the process ends successfully. If it succeeds, you will be prompted to make the question even harder.\n\n**HOW TO OPERATE:**\n1.  Review the entire conversation history. This may include a `[PREVIOUS HISTORY SUMMARY]`.\n2.  **Pay close attention to `[SYSTEM FEEDBACK]` messages which provide results from the solver or code execution.** This is new, critical information for you.\n3.  Based on the current state, decide on the best next action.\n4.  Formulate a clear, specific, and actionable prompt for the Creator LLM. Tell it exactly what you want it to do next.\n",

P(2) \u2261 0   (mod 14).\n\nDetermine the constant term k = P(0).\n```\n\n```solution\n(Internal outline \u2013 not to be shown to students)\n\nLet the distinct integer roots be r\u2081, \u2026 , r\u2085 \u2208 [\u22126,6].\n\nStep 1.  Point evaluation at 3.  \nBecause P(3)=72 and P is monic,\n\n      (3\u2212r\u2081)(3\u2212r\u2082)(3\u2212r\u2083)(3\u2212r\u2084)(3\u2212r\u2085)=72.

(\u2020)\n\nStep 2.  Congruence at x=2.  \nFor this set, P(2)=0, so P(2)\u22610 (mod 14) holds automatically.\nConversely, from (\u2020) one sees that a factor 7 divides P(2) only when\none of the roots is \u22612 (mod 7); inside [\u22126,6] that forces r=\u22125 or r=2.\nThe former is not in (\u2020); the latter is.  Thus the 7-divisibility already\npinpoints r=2 as a root, leaving (\u2020) as the sole survivor.\n\nStep 3.  Congruence at x=1.  \nFor the set (\u2020) we compute\n\n      P(1) = (1\u2212(\u22123))(1\u2212(\u22121))(1\u22122)(1\u22124)(1\u22126)\n            = 4\u00b72\u00b7(\u22121)\u00b7(\u22123)\u00b7(\u22125) = \u2212120 \u2261 6  (mod 14),\n\nso condition 3 is satisfied.  \nNo other 5-tuple from Step 1 does this (direct check).\n\nHence the quintic is uniquely determined up to expansion:\n\n      P(x) = (x+3)(x+1)(x\u22122)(x\u22124)(x\u22126).\n\nStep 4.

Generate new blueprints and add them. Only revert if the question is clearly not working.\nSend each task one by one, instead of wanting everything at once.\nAvoid using overly large numbers (More than 10 digits for example) to make a question hard.\n\n**CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n1.  **Guide and Instruct:** Direct the Creator LLM through the process of question generation, refinement, and hardening.\n2.  **Analyze and Decide:** Analyze the conversation history, including the Creator's responses and external verification results (from the solver or code execution), to decide the next logical step.\n3.  **Quality Control:** Detect and correct errors, logical flaws, or trivialities in the Creator's output. Ensure questions are non-obvious and not solvable by simple brute-force.\n4.  **Verification:** Assess question difficulty by reviewing solver attempts. Request Python verification code and **analyze the results provided in [SYSTEM FEEDBACK]** to confirm the solution's correctness. This includes handling code that fails or times out.\n5.  **Workflow Management:** Manage the entire workflow from initial idea to final, polished question.\n\n**POSSIBLE ACTIONS YOU CAN INSTRUCT THE CREATOR TO DO:**\n*   `GENERATE_INITIAL_PROBLEM`: Ask for an initial mathematical problem formulation on a given topic.\n*   `REFINE_AS_TEXTBOOK_PROBLEM`: Ask the Creator to turn a mathematical formulation into an engaging, abstract textbook-style problem, hiding the core insight.\n*   `REQUEST_HARDENING_IDEAS`: If a question seems too easy (e.g., the Solver solved it), ask the Creator for blueprints/ideas to make it harder.\n*   `CREATE_HARDER_VERSION`: Instruct the Creator to generate a new, harder question by combining the previous version with a selected hardening idea.\n*   `GENERATE_VERIFICATION_CODE`: Request a Python script to numerically verify the solution. The system will automatically run this code and provide you with the output.\n*   `CORRECT_FLAW`: If you spot a mathematical error or a flaw in the question/solution (or in the verification code's output, including timeout errors), provide a detailed correction and ask the Creator to regenerate it.\n*   `FINALIZE`: If you are satisfied with the question's difficulty, correctness, and novelty, you can state that the process is complete. The system will then perform one final check with the Solver. If the Solver fails, the process ends successfully. If it succeeds, you will be prompted to make the question even harder.\n\n**HOW TO OPERATE:**\n1.  Review the entire conversation history. This may include a `[PREVIOUS HISTORY SUMMARY]`.\n2.  **Pay close attention to `[SYSTEM FEEDBACK]` messages which provide results from the solver or code execution.** This is new, critical information for you.\n3.

SymPy brute-force (11 choose 5) verified uniqueness.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Assistant ups the difficulty (ACTION: CREATE_HARDER_VERSION)  \n\u2022 Proposed specs: move to a sextic, widen root window to [\u221215,15], keep a single exact value and two coprime-mod congruences so the search space is \u224810\u2076 and answer still unique.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 User supplies concrete harder problem  \nProblem: monic sextic P with distinct integer roots in [\u221216,16] satisfying  \n\u20031) P(5)=720\u20032) P(6)\u22610 (mod 20)\u20033) P(7)\u226115 (mod 21).  Find k = P(0).\n\nInternal solution (not shown to students)  \n1. Factor equation at x = 5: (5\u2212r\u2081)\u2026(5\u2212r\u2086)=720=2\u2074\u00b73\u00b2\u00b75.  Only two distinct 6-factor tuples fit:  \n\u2003(\u2020) {6,5,4,3,2,1} \u2192 roots {\u22121,0,1,2,3,4}  \n\u2003(\u2021) {4,3,2,1,\u22125,\u22126} \u2192 roots {11,10,3,4,2,1}.  \n2. Both sets satisfy P(6)\u22610 (mod 20).  \n3. Mod-21 test at x = 7 kills (\u2020) (gives 0), keeps (\u2021) (gives 15).  \n4. Constant term = product of surviving roots = (\u221211)(\u221210)(\u22123)(\u22124)(\u22122)(\u22121)=2640.  Hence unique answer k=2640.\n\nVerification attempt  \n\u2022 Provided SymPy script that exhaustively scans all 33 choose 6 \u2248 1.1 M root sets and asserts uniqueness (k=2640).  \n\u2022 SYSTEM feedback: execution timed-out (>30 s) \u2192 status \u201cFAILED\u201d; logical derivation still stands but code needs optimisation or longer time-limit.\n\nOutcome  \nHarder sextic variant designed and solved; unique constant term determined as k = 2640, although automated proof hit the runtime cap.\n---\n\nNEW CONVERSATION TURN TO INTEGRATE:\n---\n<ASSISTANT>:\nACTION: CORRECT_FLAW\n\nThe mathematical content of the problem looks fine, but the verification script is too slow because it builds a SymPy polynomial for every one of the 1.1 million root-sets.  \nPlease replace the heavy SymPy work with lightweight integer arithmetic:\n\n1.  For a chosen 6-tuple of distinct integers r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2086 simply compute  \n       P(x\u2080) = \u220f(x\u2080 \u2212 r\u1d62)  \n    directly as an integer product\u2014no polynomial expansion needed.\n\n2.  Test the three conditions with these integer products:\n        \u2022 P(5) == 720  \n        \u2022 P(6) % 20 == 0  \n        \u2022 P(7) % 21 == 15\n\n3.  Only when a candidate root-set passes all three tests, build the\n    monic sextic once (with SymPy or just store the product) to\n    fetch k = \u2212\u220fr\u1d62.  That will happen exactly once, so the expensive\n    step is executed only a single time.\n\nThis change should let the exhaustive search finish well under the\ntimeout limit.\n\nPlease regenerate the Python verification code accordingly (just the\ncode; no need to alter the problem statement or solution narrative).\n---\n<USER>:\n```python\n# Faster exhaustive verification using plain integer arithmetic\n# (Only build a SymPy polynomial once the unique root-set is found.)\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\nimport sympy as sp\n\nROOT_MIN, ROOT_MAX = -16, 16          # interval [\u221216,16]\nTARGET_P5          = 720              # P(5)  exact value\nMOD6, TARGET_P6    = 20, 0            # P(6) \u2261 0 (mod 20)\nMOD7, TARGET_P7    = 21, 15           # P(7) \u2261 15 (mod 21)\n\ndef prod(values):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of an iterable of ints.\"\"\"\n    p = 1\n    for v in values:\n        p *= v\n    return p\n\ngood_sets = []\n\nfor roots in combinations(range(ROOT_MIN, ROOT_MAX + 1), 6):   # 33C6 = 1 107 568\n    # Condition at x = 5  (cheap early filter)\n    if prod(5 - r for r in roots) != TARGET_P5:\n        continue\n\n    # Condition at x = 6  (mod 20)\n    if prod(6 - r for r in roots) % MOD6 != TARGET_P6:\n        continue\n\n    # Condition at x = 7  (mod 21)\n    if prod(7 - r for r in roots) % MOD7 != TARGET_P7:\n        continue\n\n    good_sets.append(roots)    # should happen exactly once\n\n# Verify uniqueness\nassert len(good_sets) == 1, f\"Expected 1 solution, got {len(good_sets)}\"\n\nroots = good_sets[0]\nk = prod(roots)               # constant term for even degree 6\n\n# Build the polynomial just once for display / final confirmation\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nP = sp.expand(sp.prod(x - r for r in roots))\n\nprint(\"Unique root set :\", roots)\nprint(\"Polynomial      :\", P)\nprint(\"Constant term k :\", k)\nprint(\"\\nNumerical checks:\")\nprint(\"  P(5) =\", P.subs(x, 5))\nprint(\"  P(6) mod 20 =\", P.subs(x, 6) % MOD6)\nprint(\"  P(7) mod 21 =\", P.subs(x, 7) % MOD7)\n```\n---\n<SYSTEM>:\n[SYSTEM FEEDBACK]\nVerification Code Status: The generated code was executed with the result: FAILED.\nCode Output/Error: Error during code execution: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/zerix/mqg/prototype.py\", line 184, in run_verification_code\n    exec(code, exec_globals)\n  File \"<string>\", line 37, in <module>\nAssertionError: Expected 1 solution, got 7\n\n---\n\nProvide the new, updated summary below.

Generate new blueprints and add them. Only revert if the question is clearly not working.\nSend each task one by one, instead of wanting everything at once.\nAvoid using overly large numbers (More than 10 digits for example) to make a question hard.\n\n**CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n1.  **Guide and Instruct:** Direct the Creator LLM through the process of question generation, refinement, and hardening.\n2.  **Analyze and Decide:** Analyze the conversation history, including the Creator's responses and external verification results (from the solver or code execution), to decide the next logical step.\n3.  **Quality Control:** Detect and correct errors, logical flaws, or trivialities in the Creator's output. Ensure questions are non-obvious and not solvable by simple brute-force.\n4.  **Verification:** Assess question difficulty by reviewing solver attempts. Request Python verification code and **analyze the results provided in [SYSTEM FEEDBACK]** to confirm the solution's correctness. This includes handling code that fails or times out.\n5.  **Workflow Management:** Manage the entire workflow from initial idea to final, polished question.\n\n**POSSIBLE ACTIONS YOU CAN INSTRUCT THE CREATOR TO DO:**\n*   `GENERATE_INITIAL_PROBLEM`: Ask for an initial mathematical problem formulation on a given topic.\n*   `REFINE_AS_TEXTBOOK_PROBLEM`: Ask the Creator to turn a mathematical formulation into an engaging, abstract textbook-style problem, hiding the core insight.\n*   `REQUEST_HARDENING_IDEAS`: If a question seems too easy (e.g., the Solver solved it), ask the Creator for blueprints/ideas to make it harder.\n*   `CREATE_HARDER_VERSION`: Instruct the Creator to generate a new, harder question by combining the previous version with a selected hardening idea.\n*   `GENERATE_VERIFICATION_CODE`: Request a Python script to numerically verify the solution. The system will automatically run this code and provide you with the output.\n*   `CORRECT_FLAW`: If you spot a mathematical error or a flaw in the question/solution (or in the verification code's output, including timeout errors), provide a detailed correction and ask the Creator to regenerate it.\n*   `FINALIZE`: If you are satisfied with the question's difficulty, correctness, and novelty, you can state that the process is complete.

If it succeeds, you will be prompted to make the question even harder.\n\n**HOW TO OPERATE:**\n1.  Review the entire conversation history.

You must intelligently decide what actions to take at each step to ensure the final question is correct, verified, and appropriately difficult.\nThe generated question MUST: not be obvious (Not give hints), only ask for one thing and have a numerical or symbolic answer (Can be as complex as pleased.).\nWhen trying blueprints, keep building on top of blueprints iteratively, don't turn back to try other ones seperately! Generate new blueprints and add them. Only revert if the question is clearly not working.\nSend each task one by one, instead of wanting everything at once.\nAvoid using overly large numbers (More than 10 digits for example) to make a question hard.\n\n**CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n1.  **Guide and Instruct:** Direct the Creator LLM through the process of question generation, refinement, and hardening.\n2.  **Analyze and Decide:** Analyze the conversation history, including the Creator's responses and external verification results (from the solver or code execution), to decide the next logical step.\n3.  **Quality Control:** Detect and correct errors, logical flaws, or trivialities in the Creator's output. Ensure questions are non-obvious and not solvable by simple brute-force.\n4.  **Verification:** Assess question difficulty by reviewing solver attempts. Request Python verification code and **analyze the results provided in [SYSTEM FEEDBACK]** to confirm the solution's correctness. This includes handling code that fails or times out.\n5.  **Workflow Management:** Manage the entire workflow from initial idea to final, polished question.\n\n**POSSIBLE ACTIONS YOU CAN INSTRUCT THE CREATOR TO DO:**\n*   `GENERATE_INITIAL_PROBLEM`: Ask for an initial mathematical problem formulation on a given topic.\n*   `REFINE_AS_TEXTBOOK_PROBLEM`: Ask the Creator to turn a mathematical formulation into an engaging, abstract textbook-style problem, hiding the core insight.\n*   `REQUEST_HARDENING_IDEAS`: If a question seems too easy (e.g., the Solver solved it), ask the Creator for blueprints/ideas to make it harder.\n*   `CREATE_HARDER_VERSION`: Instruct the Creator to generate a new, harder question by combining the previous version with a selected hardening idea.\n*   `GENERATE_VERIFICATION_CODE`: Request a Python script to numerically verify the solution. The system will automatically run this code and provide you with the output.\n*   `CORRECT_FLAW`: If you spot a mathematical error or a flaw in the question/solution (or in the verification code's output, including timeout errors), provide a detailed correction and ask the Creator to regenerate it.\n*   `FINALIZE`: If you are satisfied with the question's difficulty, correctness, and novelty, you can state that the process is complete. The system will then perform one final check with the Solver. If the Solver fails, the process ends successfully. If it succeeds, you will be prompted to make the question even harder.\n\n**HOW TO OPERATE:**\n1.  Review the entire conversation history. This may include a `[PREVIOUS HISTORY SUMMARY]`.\n2.  **Pay close attention to `[SYSTEM FEEDBACK]` messages which provide results from the solver or code execution.** This is new, critical information for you.\n3.  Based on the current state, decide on the best next action.\n4.  Formulate a clear, specific, and actionable prompt for the Creator LLM. Tell it exactly what you want it to do next.\n",
