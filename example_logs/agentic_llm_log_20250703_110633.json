Rewriting by an auxiliary resultant.  \n    Let t=x^2+k, so R_k(x)=P(t).  Then  \n    Res_x(R_k(x),Q(x)) = Res_t( P(t),  Res_x( t\u2212(x^2+k), Q(x) ) ).  \n    One checks  \n      Res_x(t\u2212(x^2+k),Q(x)) = 4 \u2212 (t\u2212k)\\bigl(t\u2212k+2\\bigr)^2  \n    \u2261 h(t) (a cubic in t).  \n    Hence  \n      Res_x(R_k,Q) = Res_t( t^3\u22122t+2 ,  \u2212t^3+(3k\u22124)t^2+\u22ef ).\n\n4.  Carrying out the resultant in t by the Euclidean\u2010division approach and a 2\u00d71\u2013root product formula one arrives (after a long but straightforward expansion) at the closed form\n\n   Res\u2093(R\u2096,Q)\n   = k^9 \n     \u221218\u2009k^8 \n     +124\u2009k^7 \n     \u2212426\u2009k^6 \n     +732\u2009k^5 \n     \u2212428\u2009k^4 \n     \u2212556\u2009k^3 \n     +1232\u2009k^2 \n     \u22121176\u2009k \n     +824.  \n\nANSWER: k^9 \u2212 18k^8 + 124k^7 \u2212 426k^6 + 732k^5 \u2212 428k^4 \u2212 556k^3 + 1232k^2 \u2212 1176k + 824.\n```\n\nBased on your comparison of the final numerical answers, provide a final decision inside a code block. The decision must be ONLY \"YES\" (if the answers are equivalent) or \"NO\" (if they are not).\n\nExample for a correct answer:\n```\nYES\n```\n\nExample for an incorrect answer:\n```\nNO\n```\n",
